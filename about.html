            I am a motivated, solution-oriented team player with a recognized aptitude for innovative thinking. 
            I am enthusiastic, responsible and hardworking. Having worked on different projects, it has helped me to 
            adapt to changes quickly and made me a mature team worker. I am able to work well both in a team 
            environment and as well as using my own initiative. I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.
